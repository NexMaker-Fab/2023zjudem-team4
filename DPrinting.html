          3D printing is an additive manufacturing process that builds a
          three-dimensional object from a digital file. An object is formed by
          adding material in layers based on the digital design in a computer
          controlled process. In other words, 3D printing refers to any computer
          controlled process that builds an object by adding material in layers
          following instructions from a digital file.

            <b>1980s</b>
          </p>
          <p class="in-the-early">
            In the early 1980s, the first documented iterations of 3D printing
            emerged. Hideo Kodama in Japan developed a layer-by-layer approach
            for manufacturing using a photosensitive resin polymerized by UV
            light. Although he couldn't file a patent, he is often credited as
            the first inventor of this manufacturing system, which is an early
            version of the modern SLA (Stereolithography) machine. Around the
            same time, a trio of French researchers also sought to create a
            rapid prototyping machine using a laser to cure liquid monomers into
            solids. They were unable to patent the technology but are still
            credited with its development. In 1986, Charles Hull filed the first
            patent for Stereolithography (SLA) and went on to found the 3D
            Systems Corporation in 1988, releasing the first commercial SLA 3D
            printer. Other additive manufacturing processes explored during this
            time include Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) and Fused Deposition
            Modeling (FDM). SLS technology fused powders using a laser, while
            FDM involved directly extruding filament from a heated nozzle. These
            three technologies served as building blocks for the growth of 3D
            printing.

          </p>
          <p class="in-the-early">
            During the period of 1990-2010, there was significant growth in the
            field of 3D printing. In the 90s, numerous companies and startups
            emerged, experimenting with different additive manufacturing
            technologies. In 2006, the first commercially available Selective
            Laser Sintering (SLS) printer was introduced, revolutionizing
            on-demand manufacturing of industrial parts. CAD tools also became
            more accessible, allowing people to develop 3D models on their
            computers, which played a crucial role in the early stages of
            creating 3D prints. The machines during this time were different
            from today's, they were difficult to use, expensive, and required
            extensive post-processing. However, continuous innovations and
            refinements were taking place. In 2005, the concept of Open Source
            had a significant impact on 3D printing, giving more people access
            to the technology. The RepRap Project, initiated by Dr. Adrian
            Bowyer, introduced the idea of an open-source 3D printer that could
            build another 3D printer and various objects. The printing of the
            first prosthetic leg in 2008 propelled 3D printing into the
            spotlight. In 2009, the expiration of Fused Deposition Modeling
            (FDM) patents from the 80s opened the door for innovation, leading
            to decreased prices and increased accessibility to 3D printers.

            In the 2010s, 3D printers became more accessible to the general
            public due to declining prices. Alongside the lower costs, the
            quality and ease of printing also improved. The materials used in 3D
            printing have evolved, with a wide variety of plastics and filaments
            now available. Additionally, materials like Carbon Fiber and Glass
            Fiber can be 3D printed. Some creative individuals have even
            experimented with printing materials such as chocolate or pasta. In
            2019, the world witnessed the completion of the largest functional
            3D printed building. 3D printing has found consistent use in
            developing hearing aids and other healthcare applications. Many
            industries and sectors have adopted this technology into their
            everyday workflow.

          <p class="s">
            Stereolithography (SL), the first commercialized 3D printing
            process, is a laser-based process that works with photopolymer
            resins. The resin, held in a vat with a movable platform, hardens
            where the laser hits the surface, forming a solid object in a
            precise manner. The platform drops down a fraction after each layer
            is completed, and the process continues until the object is
            finished.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            The SL process requires support structures for parts with overhangs
            or undercuts, which need to be manually removed. Many SL 3D printed
            objects also need to be cleaned and cured, with curing involving
            exposure to intense light to fully harden the resin.
          </p>

            SL is considered one of the most accurate 3D printing processes with
            an excellent surface finish. However, the post-processing steps
            required and the stability of the materials, which can become
            brittle over time, are limiting factors.

            <b>DLP</b>
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a 3D printing process that works
            with photopolymers, similar to Stereolithography (SL). The key
            difference is the light source. DLP uses a conventional light source
            like an arc lamp with a liquid crystal display panel or a deformable
            mirror device (DMD), applied to the entire surface of the
            photopolymer resin vat in a single pass, making it generally faster
            than SL.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            Like SL, DLP produces highly accurate parts with excellent
            resolution, but also requires support structures and post-curing. A
            notable advantage of DLP over SL is that it only requires a shallow
            vat of resin, resulting in less waste and lower running costs.

            <b>Laser Sintering / Laser Melting</b>
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            Laser sintering and laser melting are laser-based 3D printing
            processes that work with powdered materials. The laser traces across
            a powder bed of tightly compacted material, according to the 3D data
            fed to the machine, sintering or fusing the particles to each other
            to form a solid.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            The build chamber is sealed to maintain a precise temperature during
            the process, specific to the melting point of the chosen powdered
            material. Once finished, the entire powder bed is removed from the
            machine and the excess powder is removed to leave the ‘printed’
            parts. A key advantage of this process is that the powder bed serves
            as an in-process support structure for overhangs and undercuts,
            allowing for the creation of complex shapes.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            However, due to the high temperatures required for laser sintering,
            cooling times can be considerable. Porosity has been an issue with
            this process, and while there have been improvements towards fully
            dense parts, some applications still require infiltration with
            another material to improve mechanical characteristics.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            Laser sintering can process plastic and metal materials, although
            metal sintering requires a much higher powered laser and higher
            in-process temperatures. Parts produced with this process are much
            stronger than with SL or DLP, although the surface finish and
            accuracy are generally not as good.

            <b>Extrusion / FDM / FFF</b>
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            3D printing using the extrusion of thermoplastic material, known as
            Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) or Freeform Fabrication (FFF), is
            the most common 3D printing process. Developed by Stratasys in the
            early 1990s, FDM is an industrial-grade 3D printing process, while
            FFF is a more basic form used by entry-level 3D printers.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            The process works by melting plastic filament that is deposited,
            layer by layer, onto a build platform according to the 3D data
            supplied to the printer. Each layer hardens as it is deposited and
            bonds to the previous layer.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            Stratasys has developed a range of proprietary industrial-grade
            materials for its FDM process suitable for some production
            applications. At the entry-level, materials are more limited, but
            the range is growing, with ABS and PLA being the most common.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            The FDM/FFF processes require support structures for applications
            with overhanging geometries. For FDM, this involves a second,
            water-soluble material, allowing support structures to be easily
            washed away once the print is complete. Alternatively, breakaway
            support materials can be manually removed. As systems have evolved
            to incorporate dual extrusion heads, the issue of support structures
            has become less of a concern.

          <p class="s">
            Binder Jetting: In this process, a binder is selectively sprayed
            into a powder bed of the part material to fuse it layer by layer and
            create the required part. Once a layer is completed, the powder bed
            drops incrementally and a roller or blade smoothes the powder over
            the surface of the bed for the next pass of the jet heads.
            Advantages include the negation of the need for supports as the
            powder bed itself provides this functionality, the ability to use a
            range of different materials including ceramics and food, and the
            ability to easily add a full color palette to the binder. However,
            the resulting parts are not as strong as with the sintering process
            and require post-processing to ensure durability.

          <p class="s">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="s">
            Material Jetting: This process involves the selective jetting of the
            actual build materials (in liquid or molten state) through multiple
            jet heads, with others simultaneously jetting support materials. The
            materials are usually liquid photopolymers, which are cured with a
            pass of UV light as each layer is deposited. This process allows for
            the simultaneous deposition of a range of materials, meaning a
            single part can be produced from multiple materials with different
            characteristics and properties. Material jetting is a very precise
            3D printing method, producing accurate parts with a very smooth
            finish.

          <p class="s">
            Selective Deposition Lamination (SDL) is a proprietary 3D printing
            process developed by Mcor Technologies. It builds parts layer by
            layer using standard copier paper. Each new layer is fixed to the
            previous layer using an adhesive, which is applied selectively
            according to the 3D data supplied to the machine. A higher density
            of adhesive is deposited in the area that will become the part, and
            a lower density of adhesive is applied in the surrounding area that
            will serve as the support.
          </p>
          <p class="s">
            After a new sheet of paper is fed into the 3D printer and placed on
            top of the selectively applied adhesive on the previous layer, the
            build plate is moved up to a heat plate and pressure is applied.
            This pressure ensures a positive bond between the two sheets of
            paper. The build plate then returns to the build height where an
            adjustable Tungsten carbide blade cuts one sheet of paper at a time,
            tracing the object outline to create the edges of the part. The
            process repeats until the part is complete.

            SDL is one of the few 3D printing processes that can produce
            full-color 3D printed parts, using a CYMK color palette. The parts
            are standard paper, which require no post-processing, making them
            safe and eco-friendly. However, the process is not able to compete
            favorably with other 3D printing processes in the production of
            complex geometries and the build size is limited to the size of the
            feedstock.
