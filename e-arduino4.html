                    various sensors, actuators, and components to create
                    interactive and responsive devices.

            This is a project called **Particles Detector for Air Quality** by
            **yvesmorele**. The project shows how to build a device that can
            measure the concentration of fine particles (PM2.5 and PM10) in the
            air using an Arduino board, a PMS5003 sensor, a ST7735 screen, a SD
            card module, and a BME280 sensor. The device can display the data on
            the screen, save the data on the SD card, and send the data to an
            Android application via Bluetooth.
