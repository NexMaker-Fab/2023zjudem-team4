            Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that enables you to
            create interactive electronic projects. It consists of two main
            components: the Arduino board (the hardware) and the Arduino
            software (the programming environment).

            connectivity and control of various electronic components, including
            but not limited to sensors, motors, LEDs, and other peripherals.
            These input/output pins serve as interfaces through which the

            create interactive and customizable electronic systems.</span

          <p class="arduino-is-an">
            The smart planter Lua uses a variety of sensors to trigger as much
            as 15 different universal animated emotions depending on the state
            and well-being of your prized vegetal companion!
          </p>
          <p class="arduino-is-an">
            Lua checks everything from soil's moisture to light exposure and
            temperature to ensure your houseplant is as comfy as you want it to
            be. It then turns the results into easy-to-understand faces using
            its 2.4in LCD IPS screen.
