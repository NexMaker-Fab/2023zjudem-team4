          The body structure of the robot that we have created was a simple
          design. But we can actually make it an interesting and creative design

          The Theo Jansen mechanism, also known as the Jansen linkage or Jansen
          walker, is a mechanical linkage system that simulates the leg
          movements of certain walking creatures, such as insects. It was
          inspired by the leg movements of the Strandbeest, which are kinetic
          sculptures created by Dutch artist Theo Jansen. The Jansen mechanism
          consists of a complex arrangement of links and pivots that, when
          driven by a rotating crank, produces a walking motion.
        </div>
        <div class="the-body-structure">
          The mechanism usually features multiple legs. But in order to
          understand the concept behind the mechanism, it’s better to consider a
          one leg section.

          The above mentioned values are actually the mathematically proven
          numbers to match up with this mechanism. When you are trying to design
          any prototype based on this theorem, it is better to use these values
