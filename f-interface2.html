            This simple project was created by using processing 4 (4.3). This is
            a game which takes inputs from mouse and key board to change the
            color of player and to move the player around. The goal of this game
            is to move the player to green box. There are obstacles in the way
            to green box. Other colored boxes are magic boxes which helps player
            to avoid walls and other obstacles. They act as one way transporting
            portals. Player can enter from one box and come out from the second
            same colored box which appears in grid. After Reaching to the green
            box player will receive a message saying “you win”.

            positions of various boxes (box1, box4, box6, box7). If the player's
            position matches a box's position, it triggers an action: For
            instance, when the player reaches box1, they get teleported to the
            position of box2. Similarly, reaching box4 teleports the player to
            the position of box3, and so on for other boxes. The relevant
            section in the draw() function contains the logic for box
            interaction.
