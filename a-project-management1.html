          <div class="first-things-first">
            First things first, we needed a cool idea to connect all our
            projects on the website. So, we came up with this awesome concept.
            It's like having a theme that ties everything together, making it
            more interesting to the user. We decided to create a character. But
            here's the cool part: we used AI (that's artificial intelligence) to
            make this character.
          </div>
          <div class="first-things-first">
            Having a character like “Novva” can bring several benefits to our
            website. It adds personality, relatability, and memorability to your
            product. It helps create a connection with our audience and can
            serve as a recognizable symbol for our team.
          </div>
          <div class="you-can-read-container">
            If you are interested in making a character for yourself with AI,
            you can read our detailed explanation

            So, after we had our cool idea and our friendly character ready, it
            was time to make our website look awesome. For that we used Figma.
            Figma is a virtual canvas where we can draw, design, and put
            everything together. The focus of our work was to learn project
            management. As we designed our website, we also got better at using
            project management tools like Figma. These tools helped us stay
            organized and made it easier to work together, even when we're
            apart. It's like having a handy digital toolbox to keep everything
            in order.

          <div class="first-things-first">
            With our finalized design, we opened up Visual Studio. In Visual
            Studio, we wrote the code that makes our website come to life. We
            had do focus not only about the nice design of our webpage, but also
            the responsiveness and smoothness. This meant checking if buttons
            clicked, pages scrolled, and everything felt just right.

            GitHub is a digital platform where we can store and manage our code.
            It's not just for storing code, it's is a handy tool when you are
            coding as a team. It helps us keep things organized and work
            together without getting in each other's way. GitHub also lets us
            know when someone has made changes to the code. It's like having a
            chat with our teammates, and they're telling us, "Hey, I updated
            this part!" That way, we can all stay on the same page and avoid any
            confusion. At the end GitHub will help our website to become live.

          <div class="by-choosing-to">
            By choosing to design our own website from scratch, we not only had
            a unique platform but also the opportunity to learn new skills and
            enhance our project management abilities. The project allowed us to
            practice teamwork, planning, problem-solving, and effective
            communication. As a result, we've become more proficient in handling
            complex projects and working together as a team, which will
            undoubtedly benefit us in future endeavors.
