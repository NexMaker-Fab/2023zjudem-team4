        </b>
        <div class="cad-stands-for">
          This is the most common and traditional way of creating 3D models,
          where you define the shape and size of your model using parameters,
          such as dimensions, constraints, equations, and more. Parametric
          modeling allows you to create precise and consistent models that can
          be easily modified and updated by changing the parameters. Inventor
          has a robust and intuitive parametric modeling system that can create
          sketches, features, parts, and assemblies.

        <div class="cad-stands-for">
          This is a more flexible and freeform way of creating 3D models, where
          you manipulate the geometry of your model directly, without using
          parameters or constraints. Direct modeling allows you to create
          organic and complex shapes that can be difficult or impossible to
          create with parametric modeling. Inventor has a powerful and versatile
          direct modeling system that can edit, move, rotate, scale, and deform
          your model.

        <div class="cad-stands-for">
          This is a more artistic and sculptural way of creating 3D models,
          where you use tools such as push, pull, crease, bridge, and more to
          shape your model like clay. Freeform modeling allows you to create
          smooth and curved surfaces that can be hard or tedious to create with
          parametric or direct modeling. Inventor has a unique and innovative
          freeform modeling system that can create and edit T-spline surfaces,
          which are a type of surface that can blend seamlessly with NURBS
          surfaces.

          modeling allows you to create multiple and optimal design solutions
          that can meet your requirements and objectives. Inventor has a
          cutting-edge and advanced rules-based modeling system that can create

          In this blog we will talk about Computer Aided Design

          <p class="cad-software-can">
            As our second week project, we have done Computer Aided Design. In
            accordance with that here we will first talk about what is Computer
            Aided Design, some free and open-source CAD software.
          </p>
          <p class="cad-software-can">
            Then we will briefly introduce Autodesk Inventor and Fusion 360 as
            3D Modeling Software.
          </p>
          <p class="cad-software-can">
            In later part we will have a step by step guide of a 3D modeling
            Project using Fusion 360 and some practice models done by our
            teammates.
