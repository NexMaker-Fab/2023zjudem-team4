          Laser Material Processing uses laser energy to modify the shape or
          appearance of a material. This method of material modification
          provides a number of advantages such as the ability to quickly change
          designs, produce products without the need for retooling, and improve
          the quality of finished products. Another advantage of laser material
          processing is compatibility with a multitude of materials. Compatible
          materials range from non-metals such as ceramics, composites,
          plastics/polymers and adhesives to metals, including aluminum, iron,
          stainless steel, and titanium.

              The effects produced by laser energy interacting with a material
              strongly depend upon the wavelength and power level of the laser
              and the absorption characteristics and chemical composition of the
              material.

              Common wavelengths for laser material processing are 10.6 and 9.3
              micron produced by CO2 lasers and 1.06 micron produced by fiber
              lasers. A range of power levels is available for each laser type
              to optimize the laser energy-material interaction. However, the
              absorption characteristics and chemical composition of the
              material and the desired results greatly influence the selection
              of the laser type and power level.

              Laser marking is comprised of two distinct types. Laser marking
              removes material to create depth (laser depth marking) or modifies
              the material to change the color, contrast or reflectivity of the
              surface (laser surface marking). In general, laser marking is the
              production of human- and/or machine-readable identification or
              information on a material such as a barcode, date/lot code, serial
              number or part number. Other information items including logos,
              diagrams, illustrations and photographs can also be marked on a
              material. (See Figure 1 below.)

                CO2 lasers with 10.6 micron wavelength are primarily used for
                material removal to engrave non-metal materials.
              </p>
              <p class="the-effects-produced">
                CO2 lasers are not typically used for metal engraving because
                most of the laser energy is reflected. However, fiber lasers
                with 1.06 micron wavelength can be used for shallow engraving
                into metal.

                Both 10.6 micron and 9.3 micron CO2 lasers are used for marking
                non-metal materials with depth, as well as for surface marking
                of some metals. Fiber lasers with a 1.06 micron wavelength are
                used for surface marking of many materials and surface or
                shallow depth marking of metal. Laser depth marking is sometimes
                referred to as laser engraving.

                    breakage. Consider leaving a few millimeters beyond the
