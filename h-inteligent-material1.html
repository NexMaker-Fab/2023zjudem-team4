            Around 95 of the 118 elements in the periodic table are metals. They
            are the most abundant in the Earth’s crust and have various
            properties and uses. Metals can be a chemical element such as iron;
            an alloy such as stainless steel; or a molecular compound such as
            polymeric sulfur nitride. Metals are typically ductile (can be drawn
            into wires) and malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets).
            They are substances with high electrical and thermal conductivity,
            malleability, ductility, and high reflectivity of light.

            <span class="iron-is-a"
              >Aluminium is the most abundant metal on Earth, making up more
              than 8% of the matter in Earth’s crust, behind only oxygen and
              silicon. Because of its properties and abundance, it is the most
              produced and refined non-ferrous metal. Despite its abundance,
              aluminium never occurs in the metallic form in nature, but its
              compounds are present to a greater or lesser extent in almost all
              rocks, vegetation, and animals. Aluminium is soft, lightweight,
              fire-proof and heat-resistant, easy to work into new shapes, and
              able to conduct electricity. It reflects light and heat very
              effectively and it doesn’t rust. It reacts easily with other
              chemical elements, especially oxygen, and readily forms an outer
              layer of aluminum oxide if you leave it in the air.</span

            Non-metallic materials are used for a wide variety of applications
            in a range of industries, often as solutions where traditional
            metallic materials cannot be used. Non-metallic materials offer a
            range of physical and chemical properties, including having low
            thermal and electrical conductivity, making them good insulators as
            well as offering a high resistance to chemicals and corrosion. They
            can, however, be brittle and tend to have a low melting or boiling
            point. When applied with stress, non-metallic materials will often
            show an elastic, plastic, or viscous response.

              Rubber is a polymer that can stretch and shrink. It occurs
              naturally and can be synthesized as well. Natural rubber, also
              known as latex, is made from a runny, milky white liquid called
              latex that oozes from certain plants when you cut into them. Over
              99 percent of the world’s natural rubber is made from the latex
              that comes from a tree species called Hevea brasiliensis, widely
              known as the rubber tree. Synthetic rubbers are made artificially
              in a chemical plant or laboratory. Commercially, the most
              important synthetic rubbers are styrene butadiene (SBR),
              polyacrylics, and polyvinyl acetate (PVA); other kinds include
              polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polychloroprene (better known as
              neoprene), and various types of polyurethane.</span

            The development of fibres materials has accompanied the evolution of
            human civilization for centuries. Recent advances in materials
            science and chemistry offered fibers new applications with various
            functions, including energy harvesting, energy storing, displaying,
            health monitoring and treating, and computing. The unique
            one-dimensional shape of fibres devices endows them advantages to
            work as human-interfaced electronics due to the small size,
            lightweight, flexibility, and feasibility for integration into
            large-scale textile systems.</span

            A composite material is a combination of two materials with
            different physical and chemical properties. When they are combined
            they create a material which is specialized to do a certain job, for
            instance to become stronger, lighter or resistant to electricity.
            They can also improve strength and stiffness. The reason for their
            use over traditional materials is because they improve the
            properties of their base materials and are applicable in many
            situations.

            <span class="rubber-is-a"
              >: structural material manufactured by gluing together thin sheets
              of wood, called veneers or plies, with the grain of the layers
              typically arranged at wide or perpendicular angles for strength.
              Plywood is a panel product, like particleboard and fibreboard,
              meaning it is produced in flat sheets from wood-based materials
              and adhesive. Plywood has several advantages over natural wood,
              especially its dimensional stability (the measure of how much a
              material’s dimensions change due to temperature and humidity) and
              resistance to splitting. For these reasons, it is one of the most
              important wood products because wood is often used in environments
              prone to atmospheric changes or exposure to moisture.</span

            concrete in which steel is embedded in such a manner that the two
            materials act together in resisting forces. The reinforcing
            steel—rods, bars, or mesh—absorbs the tensile, shear, and sometimes
            the compressive stresses in a concrete structure. Plain concrete
            does not easily withstand tensile and shear stresses caused by wind,
            earthquakes, vibrations, and other forces and is therefore
            unsuitable in most structural applications. In reinforced concrete,
            the tensile strength of steel and the compressive strength of
            concrete work together to allow the member to sustain these stresses

            The carbon fiber reinforced polymer has many advantages as
            lightweight. It is also very strong and stiff thanks to the carbon
            fiber reinforcement whereas the polymer gives protection and grasp
            on the fiber along with toughness.

          In 2023, there were several innovative materials that were introduced.
          According to Dezeen, a design and architecture magazine, some of the
          most significant material innovations of 2023 include:

            <span
              >: A new type of window that consists of a thin layer of water
              wedged between two panes of glass, which can reduce a building’s
              energy bills by around 25% compared with standard glazing.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p class="major-uses-of-iron-include">
            British startup Water-Filled Glass has developed panes of glass
            filled with water that use sunlight to power a "crazy" energy-saving
            heating and cooling system. Its windows contain a thin layer of
            water between glass panes, which absorbs heat from sunlight or other
            radiation, such as heat leaving a room. The warmed water is then
            pumped through sealed pipes at low pressure to colder areas of the
            building, through an underfloor system or into thermal storage.
          </p>
          <p class="major-uses-of-iron-include">
            By absorbing thermal energy in this way the water-filled glass also
            limits how much solar heat gain enters the building through windows,
            reducing the need for air-conditioning in hot climates. WFG
            estimates that, depending on climate and a building's window-to-wall
            ratio, its technology can reduce energy bills by around 25 per cent
            compared with standard windows.

            <span>
              Researchers from the University of Chicago have developed a
              "chameleon-like" facade material that can change its infrared
              colour – the colour it appears under thermal imaging – based on
              the outside temperature to keep buildings cool in summer and warm
              in winter.</span

          </p>
          <p class="major-uses-of-iron-include">
            The composite material appears yellow under thermal imaging on a hot
            day because it emits heat and purple on cold days when it retains
            heat. This colour change is triggered by a small electrical impulse,
            which either deposits copper onto a thin film or strips it away.

        <div class="ceramics-ceramics-are-container">
          At the same time, it also changes the amount of infrared heat it
          absorbs or emits from the building. On hot days, the material appears
          yellow under thermal imaging, indicating that it is emitting more
          heat, while on cold days it appears purple because it is retaining
          that heat.
