            Arduino is a platform for creating electronics and programming
            projects. It consists of a physical board that can be connected to
            various components, such as sensors, LEDs, motors, etc., and a
            software environment that can be used to write and upload code to
            the board.

          The Arduino board has a microcontroller, which is a small computer
          that can run the code and interact with the components. The board also
          has pins, which are the points where the components can be attached
          using wires or a breadboard. The board can be powered by a USB cable
          or a battery, and can communicate with a computer or other devices
          using serial, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi.

        <div class="arduino-is-a-container">
          The Arduino software, also known as the Arduino IDE (Integrated
          Development Environment), is a program that allows you to write code
          in a simplified version of C++, and upload it to the board using a USB
          cable. The IDE also has a serial monitor, which can be used to view
          the data sent and received by the board, and a library manager, which
          can be used to install additional libraries that provide more
          functionality and support for different components.

          Arduino is useful for makers and hobbyists because it is easy to use,
          affordable, and versatile. You can use Arduino to create a variety of
          projects, from simple blinking LEDs to complex robots, smart home
          devices, musical instruments, and more. Arduino is also open-source,
          which means that anyone can use, modify, and share its hardware and
          software designs. This encourages creativity, collaboration, and
          innovation among the Arduino community.

          libraries, and the Arduino tools. You can also contribute to these
          projects by reporting issues, suggesting features, or submitting pull

          The Arduino board is a compact and programmable circuit board that
          integrates a microcontroller as its central component. The
          microcontroller functions as a miniature computer capable of executing
          specific tasks based on programmed instructions. Arduino boards are
          available in diverse forms and dimensions, while consistently
          featuring input/output pins that facilitate connectivity and control
          of various electronic components, including but not limited to
          sensors, motors, LEDs, and other peripherals. These input/output pins
          serve as interfaces through which the Arduino board can interact with
          external devices, enabling users to create interactive and
          customizable electronic systems.

              setup(): The setup() function is called when a sketch starts. Use
              it to initialize variables, pin modes, start using libraries, etc.
              The setup function will only run once, after each powerup or reset
              of the board.

              loop(): After creating a setup() function, the loop() function
              does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively,
              allowing your program to change and respond as it runs. Code in
              the loop() section of your sketch is used to actively control the
              board.

            Digital and Analog I/O: Arduino boards have digital and analog
            input/output pins that allow you to interact with the physical
            world. The Arduino language provides functions to read from and
            write to these pins. For example, you can use digitalRead() to read
            the state of a digital pin or analogWrite() to output a PWM (Pulse
            Width Modulation) signal.

          Once you have written your code, click on the "Verify" button
          (checkmark icon) in the toolbar to compile your code. This step
          ensures that there are no syntax errors in your code. If the
          verification is successful, you can proceed to upload the code to your
          Arduino board by clicking on the "Upload" button (right arrow icon) in
          the toolbar.
